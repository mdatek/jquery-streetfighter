		<p>Ryu is always waiting for your instructions.</p>
		<p>To let him know he should expect a command, move your mouse over him.</p>
		<p>When your ready for him to unleash hadouken, click on him.</p>
		<p>And, sometimes, he gets a little bored waiting for commands. That's when he starts acting "cool". Just tap the 'X' key on the keybord, and he'll have wind in his hair.</p>
